# DDEV GitLab CI - Docker in Docker (dind)

A container image to run DDEV on any GitLab Runner (hosted/self-hosted).

## Configuration for GitLab Runners

The Runner can run on the two container engines - Docker and Podman.
Both container engines work, but the required configuration is slightly different.

### Example configurations

Depending on your setup, you want to pick one of the following example configurations.

* [gitlab.com](docs%2Fgitlab-com.md)
* [Docker](docs%2Fdocker.md) (self-hosted)
* [Podman](docs%2Fpodman.md) (self-hosted)

## Image build (for contribution only)

If you want to extend the image, you'll find the instructions
and details below.

Build the image:

```bash
./build.sh -v <version, at least major.minor> -p
```

Available options:
 * v - DDEV version e.g. 'v1.23.1'
 * l - Load the image (--load)
 * p - Push the image (--push)
 * x - Build multi-arch image (--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64)
